# Graph Library

This `Graph` library provides a class for creating, managing, and analyzing graphs. It supports both weighted and unweighted graphs with options for adjacency matrix or adjacency list representations. The library includes methods for reading from files, calculating node statistics, performing searches (BFS and DFS), finding connected components, and estimating the graph diameter.

## Features

- **Graph Representations**: Supports both adjacency list and adjacency matrix.
- **Weighted and Unweighted Edges**: Handles graphs with or without edge weights.
- **Graph Metrics**: Calculates min, max, mean, and median degrees of nodes.
- **Traversal Methods**: Includes BFS and DFS for both adjacency list and matrix.
- **Diameter Calculation**: Estimates the graph's diameter.
- **Connected Components**: Finds all connected components in the graph.

## Installation

To use this library, clone this repository and make sure the following dependencies are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
